	<p>This app was created during a 7 day summer camp hosted by the Everett Program at the University of California at Santa Cruz, by a group of outstanding young women. Without knowing any code, they worked tirelessly to learn HTML and jQuery Mobile while simultaneously learning about health, food justice, ethical consumption, and workers rights.</p>
	
	<p>We hope that this app will inspire you to become an advocate of Food Justice in your community.</p>

<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>The 2015 YEI team extends a warm thank you to everyone involved in making our camp a success. 
This year's camp would not have been possible without the help from the following programs.</p> 



<div class="center-img"><img src="pics/logos/everett-logo.png" /></div>
<p class="noelipsis">The Everett Program is a social innovation lab stationed at UCSC for undergraduate students. Formerly known as the Global Information Internship Program, Everett has been an incubator for student-led projects since 1998. Everett projects blend student's passions for social justice issues with the latest technology to create sustainable and innovative solutions. Everett students have conducted projects all around the world and on a wide variety of issues ranging from women's empowerment to sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>The Youth Empowerment Institue is an ongoing project that is sustained by a regular staff and by new students every year. The 2014 YEI group created an award winning "YEI College Mentor App" that is available for download in iTunes and Android stores. Although the themes and technologies have changed throughout the years, the main goal of YEI has remained the same--empowering local youth with the technological skills to become leaders in their communities.To learn more about about Everett and YEI, please visit everettprogram.org and everettprogram.org/yei. </p>


<div class="center-img"><img src="pics/logos/fcwa-logo.png" /></div>
<p>The Food Chain Workers Alliance is a coalition of worker-based organizations whose members plant, harvest, process, pack, transport, prepare, serve, and sell food, organizing to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain. The Alliance works together to build a more sustainable food system that respects workers’ rights, based on the principles of social, environmental and racial justice, in which everyone has access to healthy and affordable food.</p>

<p>Joann Lo of the FCWA volunteered her time and professional expertise to help make the workers rights portion of the camp a success.</p>


<div class="center-img"><img src="pics/logos/nest-logo.png" /></div>
<p class="noelipsis">The Digital Nest is an open tech space for young adults aged 12-24. The NEST is located in Watsonville, CA and provides local youth with free access to WiFi, laptops, and other types of tech equipment. Their goal is to train and equip today's youth with the resources and skills needed to become the leading tech workforce of tomorrow.</p>
<p>As a member of the NEST, you can sign up for workshops taught by industry professionals that range from topics such as web design, video production, robotics, and more. Some members have already been able to apply their skills in the real world by being matched to employers for jobs such as creating websites. The Digital NEST has only just opened their doors last year, but they are already grossing over 400 members and are looking to expand.</p>
<p>If you would like to donate, become a member, or learn more about this booming organization, please visit digitalnest.org. The YEI team thanks the NEST for helping us with recruitment and for providing a tech space where the campers are able to continue developing their coding skills.</p>


<div class="center-img"><img src="pics/logos/foodwhat-logo.png" /></div>
<p class="noelipsis">Food What?! is a fellow youth empowerment program that focuses predominantly on promoting Food Justice through sustainable agriculture. Their program recruits Watsonville youth to join their crew for various positions throughout the seasons: from internships in the spring, to jobs in the summer, and then business management positions in the fall. Their program's location bounces between farms in Watsonville and and the farm on the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>Not only do they teach youth how to be ethical consumers of the food they eat, they also adress major injustices surrounding access to healthy food in their communities. The FoodWhat?! Program creates a safe environment for youth to practice job skills, develop confidence, and undergo personal transformations.  The 2015 YEI team thanks FoodWhat?! for sharing their knowledge on Food Justice with this year's campers.</p>

						<h4>1846-1848</h4>
						<p>After the Mexican-American war, tens of thousands of migrant Mexican workers moved freely in and out of The United States for seasonal jobs.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1865-1866</h4>
						<p>After the Civil War, Southern states passed laws named "Black Codes" that limited the rights of African Americans. Part of this law required them to have a special permit if they wanted to work in something other than agriculture.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1860-1870</h4>
						<p>Government passed amendments to the Constitution that benefited the African American community: the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, the 14th Amendment gave everyone born in the United States citizenship status, and the 15 Amendment gave African American men the right to vote.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1860-1930</h4>
						<p>As members of the African American community moved to other industries, the farming industry continued to grow making the need for workers to grow as well. The United Stated then began to gather workers from Asia. Around this time, 7/8 farmworkers were Asian. The treatment they received was no different than those of the African American community.</p>
	   				</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1882</h4>
						<p>The United States banned employment for Chinese workers as part of The Chinese Exclusion Act.This was the first attempt to stop the flow of immigrants from a specific ethnic group coming to the US.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1890-1900</h4>
						<p>Despite all of the amendements that had passed, segregation continued under the Jim Crow Laws. African Americans were still being treated like slave workers because many were in debt with landowners. They only got a partial share of the crops they worked for.</p>
					</div>  
	  
					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1914-1918</h4>
						<p>Migration from Europe to the US decreased during WWI, making the demand for Mexican farmworkers increase and resulting in more than 70,000 Mexican workers into The United States.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1929-1936</h4>
						<p>The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, which was a huge dust storm that covered an area of 150,000 squared miles in central United States, caused many white landowners to lose their land. This potentially caused the Mexican Repatriation policy to be authorized. This policy caused over 500,000 Mexican-Americans to be deported. Around this time the U.S. government also passed labor laws that specifically excluded farmworkers from basic worker rights, such as workers compensation, overtime pay, collective bargaining, and laws against child labor.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1942</h4>
						<p>A temporary work-visa program was created known as the Bracero Program. This allowed foreign workers, mostly Mexicans, to come to the United States for seasonal jobs. After the season was over they would go back home.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1962</h4>
    					<p>Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta joined to create the United Farmworkers in California. To this day this organization keeps fighting for farmworker rights.</p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1964</h4>
						<p>The Bracero program ended in 1964. Since it ended, farm workers from the Bracero program are still fighting to get the 10% mandatory reduction from their wages that they were supposed to receive once their contract ended and left the U.S. </p>
					</div>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h4>1970-Today</h4>
						<p>As this timeline shows, the common pattern throughout history is that the majority of farmwork in the United States is done by immigrants. Millions have come to this country for agricultural labor--sometimes forcibly, sometimes voluntarily, and sometimes only on a temporary basis. Beginning again in 1970, farmworkers have mostly come from Mexico and Central America. It is calculated that about 75% of these farmworkers are undocumented. In addition, a modern day version of the Bracero program currently exists and is known as the H-2A program. This federal program allows immigrants temporary work visas for farm labor. </p>

					<p>Many fieldworkers in the Watsonville area begin working in April and end around November. Because of this temporary basis, hardly any workers receive benefits or raises. There are hundreds of workers who have been working in the same fields for 20+ years, but have never received a raise (except for when the federal minimum wage raises).</p>

                    <h3>Unpaid Sick Days</h3>
                    <p>Field workers must pack as much produce as they can in order to make a certain amount of money. These workers don't have sick leave, meaning if they take a sick day off they will not make any money. Many of these field workers cannot afford to lose a day worths of money so they decide to go to work instead.</p>
					<p><h4>The Effects:</h4>If the person who is sick attends work, it is possible for the worker to infect the produce they are picking and the people they are working around. This worker can be endangered of getting more sick--leading to a disease or something worse.</p>

                    <h3>Pesticide Exposure</h3>
                    <p>Pesticides are commonly used on farms and are meant for attracting and destroying pests. Field workers often are not safely protected from pesticides and must work alongside them.</p>
                    <p><h4>The Effects:</h4>Pesticides contain many poisonous chemicals that can lead to male and female infertility if the body is exposed to it. The effects of pesticides can also be passed down from a mother to a baby. Exposure to pesticides is also linked to certain types of cancer.</p>

                    <p>Staying hydrated is very important for staying healthy, especially under hot working conditions. Drinking enough water means that you need to be able to use the bathroom consistently. For many field workers, however, breaks are too short and sometimes rushed, leaving no time to use the bathroom.</p>
                    <p><h4>The Effects:</h4>Workers face the dilemma of having to choose between using the restroom and getting behind in their work--or--not drinking water and avoiding  the restroom. Many choose not to drink water, causing serious damage to their health. Workers can pass out and even die if they are not hydrated enough.</p>

		<h3>Verbal Abuse</h3>
		<p>Working in the fields is very difficult, especially for women. Most female fieldworkers experience some sort of sexual harassment while working in the fields. Sexual harassment often occurs because farm workers rarely,if ever, receive sexual harassment training. A common form of sexual harassment is catcalling. Catcalling is when a women receives an unwanted comment, whistle, or shout of a sexual nature.</p>

		<p> <strong>Injuries</strong> </p>
		<p>Many field workers in California and around the nation are undocumented immigrants, so when they do injure themselves at work they are sometimes too afraid to confront their supervisor. Having an injury can mean that they'll get fired and become unable to provide for their families, or worse, get deported. When field workers do get injured and they file for workers compensation, they most likely don't get it. A common injury field workers face are back pains. The back pain could be hurting them so badly that they need to see a doctor. It's unfair how field workers can tolerate all that pain, while most people can even tolerate a simple pinch.</p>
